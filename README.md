# Chennai_housing_predictions
Contributors - VIKAS, AKSHAT, YASH.
The aim of this project is to predict the prices of houses in Chennai. A dataset
was provided in Kaggle. From the dataset, some exploratory data analysis and
pre-processing were done to prepare the dataset for training. After some
research about various algorithms and ML models, it was clear that we needed
to implement regression models, which were Linear Regression, and Random
Forest Regressor, RandomizedSearchCV , XG Boost in Google Colab.
Google Colab is a great online Jupyter notebook to build ML models because
various libraries for various models are already present, we do not need to
download them.
Machine Learning is a suitable approach for these types of problems which
require you to predict the trends in the dataset. Machine learning is important
because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behaviour and
operational business patterns and supports the development of new
products. Many of today's leading companies, such as Facebook,
Google, and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations.
Machine learning has become a significant competitive differentiator for many
companies.
